Your first page!!!!!

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

To add photos, just link them like this:

![drew the alien]({{ jcrobles.github.io }}/images/alien_drew.jpeg)!

You can also create [links][test-link] super easily!

* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
+  this will show as number "2"
*  this will show as number "3."
9. any number, +, -, or * will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level
