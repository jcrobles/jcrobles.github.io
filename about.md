This is intended to be a depository for all the things that I am interested in and enjoy doing. Just to give you an idea, here are some of the things that you can expect to see. 
Cooking/Baking
	I really enjoy cooking and baking, though currently I am not great at creating my own recipes from scratch (though maybe one day!). I do try out a lot of different recipes and have trouble keeping track of the ones I like and why I like them. I hope that this blog will help we with that.  
Crochet
	No, I am not 60 years old. Yes, I have found a love for crocheting. When I was young I used to spend my summers with my grandparents. During this time my grandma worked hard to improve my grandma-skills-fu: I learned to knit, as well as embroidery (one of those summers I embroidered a set of dishtowels for my mother). Back in those days, the summers were the only times that I would do things like this. When I would go back home my time was better spent riding my horse or doing something else related to horses. Now, I find Grandma-fu skills to be incredibly relaxing. And I have to say that it is nice being able to make something with your hands. 
Photography 
	I am nowhere close to being a professional photographer but I try my best to take good photos. In all honesty I could take 50 photos and only 2 of them may be good. I hope to share some of the good ones with you. 
Travel 
	In recent years I have been traveling a lot more. This is mostly due to having a partner in my life why loves to travel. Prior to him the extent of my travel was to Mexico on family vacations. Note: I am from San Diego so going across the border is not always the most exciting of vacations. The first time I ever went to Europe was in 2014 and I have been back every year since. It will be my goal each year to go to a place I have never been before!
Gardening 
	I have always loved plants! I tend to tell people that I have a “plant problem.” Starting in college I would go to the local Walmart and buy the plants that were on sale because they were being killed. Ever since I have collected plants, but don’t get me wrong I have also killed plants as well.  I hope to share my successes and my failures along the way.
